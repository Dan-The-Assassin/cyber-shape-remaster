* DONE/BUGGY Implement rhythm based shooting.
The ~RhythmTimer.CheckTime~ method returns a boolean indicating
whether or not the player is allowed to shoot (has clicked on-beat
with a small margin of error indicated by the ~pityTime~ parameter).

It doesn't always allow you to shoot on-beat and we're still trying to
figure out why.

* DONE Add UI for player health and shooting.
The ~PlayerHealth~ class handles rendering the player's health and the
~RhythmUI~ and ~RhythmLine~ classes handle showing the moving bars to
indicate when is the player allowed to shoot.

* DONE Add enemy health.
Enemies now have health controlled by the ~health~ field on the
~EnemyController~ class and a bar above their heads indicating how
much of it they have left.

* DONE Make enemies take damage and die when hit by player's projectiles.
The ~EnemyController.TakeDamage~ method handles damaging the enemies
whenever a player's projectile hits them (see ~Bullet.OnTriggerEnter~).

* DONE/BUGGY Get rid of projectiles after they hit something.
~Bullet.OnTriggerEnter~ starts the ~Bullet.Reload~ coroutine which
disables the bullet's renderer for a while and resets its position.

Sometimes the projectiles pass through walls. We don't know the reason yet.

* DONE/BUGGY Make enemies move towards player.
Enemies now have a Nav Mesh Agent component on them and each level has
a baked navmesh. The enemies are moved in ~EnemyController.Update~ by
calling ~SetDestination~ on their ~NavMeshAgent~ component.

Enemies seem to be spawning and travelling too high on the Y axis, so
that the player's bullets sometimes pass under them. We're looking for
a fix.

* DONE Make enemies shoot the player.
When the player is in the range of an enemy, it shoots. See
~EnemyController.Update~ and ~EnemyController.Shoot~.

* DONE Tie evolution to kills/score.
Every 5 points (kills), the player changes shape. See ~Player.AddScore~.

* DONE Add real levels with obstacles.
Now we have 2 levels with obstacles. See =Level 1.unity= and =Level
2.unity= inside the =Scenes= folder.

* DONE/BUGGY Fix existing projectile orbit bugs & Improve orbit exit for projectile.
Now if the projectile selected for shooting would be coming from
behind the player, instead of passing through the player it
accelerates in orbit and shoots after it rotates enough for a clean
orbit exit.

However, in some cases after you play for a while the orbit's center
is moving away from the center of the player.

* DONE/BUGGY Figure out when and make projectiles respawn in orbit.
Projectiles now respawn whenever they collide with something.

The problem is that they don't seem to realize that walls are worth
colliding with sometimes.

* DONE Make camera follow player.
Done. See ~CameraController~.

* DONE Add proper meshes for projectiles & Make more projectile types.
See =Prefabs/Bullets=. Now the default projectiles orbiting the player
are some kind of rockets rather than boring capsules.

* DONE Ensure everything in the scene has at least a basic material.
