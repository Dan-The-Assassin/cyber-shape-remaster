* Bug fixing
- Find out why the RhythmTimer ends up being off-beat sometimes.
- Prevent projectiles from passing through walls. Always.
- Make enemies roll on the ground rather than levitate.
- Fix new projectiles orbit bugs.

* New stuff
- Add particle effects on evolution.
- Add particle effects on bullet collisions.
- Change rhythm system so that shooting on beat increases the damage,
  but you're allowed to shoot anytime.
- Add a menu.
- Spawn enemies in waves.
- Progress to next level when the player has defeated all waves.
- Prevent enemies from spawning in walls, maybe with predefined spawn
  points in each map.
